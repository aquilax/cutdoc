      name: View Manipulation
      items:
        - key: q
          action: Close view, if multiple views are open it will jump back to the previous view in the view stack. If it is the last open view it will quit. Use Q to quit all views at once.
        - key: Enter
          action: This key is "context sensitive" depending on what view you are currently in. When in log view on a commit line or in the main view, split the view and show the commit diff. In the diff view pressing Enter will simply scroll the view one line down.
        - key: Tab
          action: Switch to next view.
        - key: R
          action: Reload and refresh the current view.

          action: Maximize the current view to fill the whole display.
        - key: Up
          action: This key is "context sensitive" and will move the cursor one line up. However, if you opened a diff view from the main view (split- or full-screen) it will change the cursor to point to the previous commit in the main view and update the diff view to display it. If you prefer this key to move the cursor or scroll within the diff view instead, use bind diff <Up> move-up or bind diff <Up> scroll-line-up, respectively.
        - key: Down
          action: Similar to Up but will move down.
        - key: ,
          action: Move to parent. In the tree view, this means switch to the parent directory. In the blame view it will load blame for the parent commit. For merges the parent is queried.
    - group:
      name: View Specific Actions
      items:
        - key: u
          action: Update status of file. In the status view, this allows you to add an untracked file or stage changes to a file for next commit (similar to running git-add <filename>). In the stage view, when pressing this on a diff chunk line stages only that chunk for next commit, when not on a diff chunk line all changes in the displayed diff are staged.
        - key: M
          action: Resolve unmerged file by launching git-mergetool(1). Note, to work correctly this might require some initial configuration of your preferred merge tool. See the manpage of git-mergetool(1).
        - key: !
          action: Checkout file with unstaged changes. This will reset the file to contain the content it had at last commit.
